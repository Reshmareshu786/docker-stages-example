# docker-stages-example
This repository contains two Docker examples:  Multi-Stage Build: Demonstrates how to create a smaller Docker image by separating build and runtime environments.  Single-Stage Build: Shows a simple approach where the build and runtime are combined in a single image.  Use this repo to explore the differences and benefits of each Docker build method.
